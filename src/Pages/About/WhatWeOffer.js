            <u>DJ Workshops</u>
            <br/>
            We host accessible vinyl and digital workshops on club standard equipment. Multiple teachers share their personal tips and tricks.  Hands-on practising is a mainstay of each workshop. 
            <br/><br/>
            <u>Club Events</u>
            <br/>
            To diversify the local club scene we throw parties of various genres and book DJs regardless of their social media following. Mentees get a chance to play in a real club environment.
            <br/><br/>
            <u>Hosting Mixes</u>
            <br/>
            The rule is simple: anyone can send in a mix. We give a platform to DJs and on a weekly basis, offer our growing listening fan base the opportunity to discover new artists.
            <br/><br/>
            <u>Access to Equipment & Private DJ Lessons</u>
            <br/>
            Equipment and DJ lessons are expensive - but not with us. It's important for us to make these things reasonably accessible and even offer discounts for mentees.
            <br/><br/>
            <u>Community</u>
            <br/>
            Weâ€™re an LGBTQIA+, BIPOC and FLINTA* friendly space. We'll always prioritise those who are less privileged but welcome all who respect our values. DJ newbies, DJs with skills to share, graphic designers, videographers, photographers, etc. Shoot us a message to find out how you can get involved or click <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScTPJWT7WLkgy26xdZnbTxcE8lOrRBWziPr8LY9zrWFiRxhYg/viewform?pli=1" target="_blank">here</a>. We're building a community where you belong: the wallflower, the nerd, the underdog, the dark horse, the nonconformist, the enthusiast and the eager. We're bringing something that is made for you. Come by and check out one of our events where we'd love for you to stick around, connect with others, and become a real part of our community. After all, it ain't done properly without you.
